Governance


The framework is divided into two parts. Part 1 offers an overview of the risks and characteristics of trustworthy AI systems. Part 2, the AI RMF Core, outlines four functions to help organizations address AI system risks:

Govern: Creating an organizational culture of AI risk management
Map: Framing AI risks in specific business contexts
Measure: Analyzing and assessing AI risks
Manage: Addressing mapped and measured risks

I need an introduction with risks 

and then the methods to mitigate these risks

### AI Risk Management Project Charter

Project Title:
AI Risk Management & Compliance Framework Deployment

**Purpose:**

To establish a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) program for AI systems that ensures regulatory alignment (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 23894), mitigates operational and ethical risks, and embeds continuous risk monitoring and control effectiveness assessment into the AI lifecycle.

**Objectives:**

* Identify and inventory all AI systems across the enterprise

* Classify AI systems per applicable laws and internal risk standards

* Evaluate, document, and mitigate AI-specific risks

* Implement ongoing monitoring, governance, and recertification workflows

**Scope:**

* All AI models (traditional ML, LLMs, GenAI, embedded third-party APIs)

* Internal tools and customer-facing AI features

* Covers development, deployment, and post-deployment lifecycle

**Assumptions:**

* Existing cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy frameworks are in place

* Technical teams can provide metadata, system architecture, and access to logs

**Constraints:**

* Resource allocation and data availability

* Evolving regulatory landscape (EU AI Act, UK equivalents, U.S. state laws)

**Stakeholders:**

* Project Sponsor: Chief Risk Officer

* Risk Manager: AI Risk & Compliance Lead

* Tech Teams: AI/ML Engineering, Data Science, DevSecOps

* Compliance: DPO, Legal, Governance teams

##  AI Risk Management Governance RACI Matrix

The RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) defines clear ownership and collaboration roles across the AI lifecycle. It ensures that all stakeholders  from data protection and legal to engineering and risk management  understand their responsibilities for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring AI-related risks. This structure supports transparency, accountability, and compliance with evolving AI regulations such as the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF.
